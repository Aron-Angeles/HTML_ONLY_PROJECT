            <h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm <em>A-ron Angeles</em></h1>    
            <p>I am the author of this website. This project is entirely made of HTML. This was only made to see the full extent of my knowledge regarding HTML and to have some fun tinkering
                with the technology. Enjoy! <br>

            <h2>The Goal</h2>
            <p>Before writting the code for this project, my plan was to include all of the syntax that are included in HTML5 web development. <br> 
                However, as my knowledge regarding HTML expanded, I learned that not every tags are useful when creating a website <br>
                This website is not perfect, the homepage is obviously sarcastic but I managed to learn a lot regarding HTML by creating my very own website <br>
                Let met tell you something, <strong>IT'S FUNNNNN</strong>.
            </p>

            <h2>Next Step</h2>
            <p>Obviously the next step is learning CSS. This website will never contain a CSS tag or syntax. I don't have anyplan on applying any form of styling. This website as stated is a project using pure HTML <br>
                This is my first step on becoming a real programmer, and one day I will be. Goodluck to future self. I hope you remember writing this small project .
